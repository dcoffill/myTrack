myTrack
===========

About
-----
myTrack is an application written by George Chen, David Coffill, Ziping He, Shuai Lang, and Xinzhe Wang for the Android platform.  myTrack is meant to keep track of where you've been, and organize the important moments in your life by location and time.  myTrack is intended for Android 4.0 and above.


Use
---
To use myTrack, simply install the APK file onto your device and launch the application.  To record your location, press the "Record Location" button on the Action Bar.  You will then be able to view your location on the map or in a list view (see Known Bugs).  To switch between map and list views, swipe from the left edge to reveal the navigation drawer.  To adjust the (currently non-functioning) settings menu, tap the overflow menu in the top right corner and choose "Settings".


Setting up your environment
---------------------------

In order to develop and build myTrack, you must install Android studio[1] 0.4.0 or higher (last built against 0.4.6, recommended version).  Once the SDK is installed, you must use the SDK manager (Main Menu Bar > Tools > Android > SDK Manager) to install the "Google Repository" and "Google Play Services" [2], [3].  Many of these steps have already been performed though (such as modifying AndroidManifest.xml to include the API key) so you should only need to install these files from the SDK manager.

In addition, this application will not run correctly (maps will not work, application may force close) unless the proper signing key is used in the build process (as only .apk files generated and signed by approved keys will work with the Google Maps Android API).  If you do not have an existing Android environment whose keys you care about, the easiest way to do this is to copy the debug.keystore file to the proper location on your environment [4].

Alternatively, if you do not wish to build the application yourself, there is a pre-built APK file provided in the root of the repository.

Known Bugs
----------
* When using the contextual action bar in MTLocationList ("History" from within our application), which is triggered by tapping and holding on a given item, items are not highlighted when selected.
* You tell me!
